# JavaScript & TypeScript

JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS) are extremely closely related:

- JavaScript is the runtime language executed by browsers and Node.js.
- TypeScript is a **superset** of JavaScript that adds **static typing** and a compiler.

This section teaches the two **side-by-side**.

## How to use these notes

- When you see `{% tabs %}` blocks, you can switch between the JavaScript and TypeScript versions of the same idea.
- JavaScript examples focus on **runtime behavior**.
- TypeScript examples focus on **compile-time guarantees**, better tooling, and safer refactors.
